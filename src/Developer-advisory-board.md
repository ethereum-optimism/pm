# Collaborating with the Developer Advisory Board

The Developer Advisory Board (DAB) is a group of 7 elected, independent protocol developers responsible for reviewing and approving regular (non-maintenance)upgrades.

## When and how to engage the DAB

There are a few simple expectations around involving the DAB as part of the existing SDLC.

### Design Doc / Design Review
When you draft a new design doc or schedule a design review, invite the DAB lead @wildmolasses (Ed) and give access to the doc.

### Project management hub / draft specs
When you create a project management hub or draft specs for a release, give the DAB lead @wildmolasses (Ed) access, and make sure to set permissions so Ed can add the rest of the DAB to the page.

### Alphanet / Betanet phase
When a release candidate is cut, with specs and technical details known, start drafting the governance proposal and share it with the DAB in draft form (google doc, notion). Use [this template](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/Protocol%20Upgrade%20Template.md).

At this point, you likely won't have the final absolute prestate hash, transaction payloads etc. but you should be able to draft the proposal without these details. This will allow the DAB to familiarise themselves with the proposal, spec and technical details as early as possible, and provide feedback to accelerate the process later on.

### Betanet / Sepolia phase
As soon as you are able to provide the final details of the upgrade proposal (absolute prestate hash, payloads etc.), add these to the proposal draft and publish to the forum, once again letting the DAB lead know. Please also let Julian from the Foundation know. This will trigger the 7d DAB approval window, followed by the 7d stakeholder veto window.
